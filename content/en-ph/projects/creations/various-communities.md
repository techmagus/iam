#### PhilGaming.Community

- Administrator
- Years: 2004–2007
- CMS: Xaraya (a fork of PostNuke)
- Forums: Invision Power Board (IPB); Simple Machines Forums (SMF)

The **PhilGaming.Community** was a gaming website and online forums which catered to the emerging Philippine online gaming industry. It was powered by **Xaraya** CMS (a fork of **PostNuke** CMS) which gave us the ability to easily provide the latest news, game updates, and community articles. The community forums ran on **Invision Power Board**, and we were one of the first gaming website and community which ran on **IPB**. This eventually led to local gaming companies to migrate to the same forum software.

#### Laibcoms.Community

- Administrator
- Years: 1998–2007
- Forums: Ultimate Bulletin Board (UBB); Invision Power Board (IPB); Simple Machines Forums (SMF)

Sometime in 1998, I started to build my first online community forums. It was powered by **Ultimate Bulletin Board** or **UBB**, one of the oldest online forum software. This was the beginning of the **Laibcoms.Community**. The **Laibcoms.Community** was an online community forums visited by English-speaking individuals from Asia and the rest of the world. There were sections for anime, gaming, life, movies, and books, to mention a few.

#### Webrings and mailing lists/groups

- Ringmaster; administrator
- Years: 1998–2007
- Platforms: WebRing; eGroups and Y! Clubs (later combined as Y! Groups)

During these same years, I was also active in managing webrings and mailing lists/groups. There were many large webrings and mailing lists which were transferred to me, or I took over after the account of the original owners expired. Where needed, I established new guidelines, assigned new moderators, and developed programs to revitalise these communities.
