The **Kolverse Worldbuilding and Writing Project** (**KWWP** / **Kolverse Project**) is a collaborative shared world project under a Creative Commons-Attribution-ShareAlike (CC-BY-SA) 4.0 International License. It aims to build a database of CC-BY-SA worldbuilding materials authors can use for their stories.

By licensing all works under CC-BY-SA 4.0 International License, we elevated the *unofficial* status of fan-made works. All fan-made works share the same status as the original, and the author does not have to delete their works because of a potential *Copyright infringement* when they make it big.

Worldbuilders can continue creating new materials, and authors can concentrate on writing new stories. Two different aspects of creative fiction that requires a different set of skills. Through the *Kolverse Worldbuilding and Writing Project*, we are providing worldbuilders a place to share their works, and authors a database of source materials for their next great adventure.
