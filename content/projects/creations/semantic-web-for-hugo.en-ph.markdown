**Semantic Web for Hugo** adds *structured data* and *linked data* into a Hugo-powered website. Through it, search engines can easily read the data of a Hugo-powered website and establish relationships between objects. This enables search engines to intelligently store information about a website and use it to increase a website’s exposure in search results.
